Robotics and Software Engineering 2024 (RSE'24) is the third edition of an unofficial and annual meeting to promote discussion and interaction between researchers. The main objective is to strengthen cooperation and dialogue, bringing together the communities of Robotics and Software Engineering. It is an ideal opportunity to exchange ideas on topics of interest, including (but not limited to): development of systems, software architecture, dependability, software reuse, software validation and verification, robot modeling, robot control architectures, autonomous systems, and multi-robot systems.

The format of RSE'24 meeting consists of short presentations from each participant with enough time for discussion. Researchers at different career stages are wellcome to present their research, provide and get feedback from peers, engage into discussions and establish new collaborations. RSE is not a publication venue. Participants can present previously published work as well as unpublished work, including early ideas and work in progress, can be a published paper, an idea, a master thesis, etc. The main point is to encourage discussions, to give and receive feedback, and to create a network for new collaborations.

RSE'24 will take place at the [University of Bremen](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/) in Germany, from **September 2nd until September 5th, 2024**.
In this edition, we plan for a four-day event, from Monday 11:00 to Thursday at 15:00. 
RSE'24 does not require any paper submission, however, an abstract about the research that is to be presented is required to apply. 
The program is advertised but will be flexible in the sense that one can jump in if the talk fits well as a follow-up to another talk. Thus, everyone should be prepared to give their talk at any time, which gives synergy to the event.
