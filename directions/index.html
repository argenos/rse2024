    <h2>Travel Information</h2>
    <p>
        GSSI is located in the core of L'Aquila historic centre. L'Aquila is a city situated in Abruzzo region, in the centre of Italy. It is about 110 Km to the east of Rome. It is possible to arrive by flight, rail, or road. Detailed travel information about how to reach L'Aquila and the GSSI can be found below. <!--(the following information was obtained from the <a href="https://indico.gssi.it/event/379/page/121-venue-and-travel-information">UHECR2022</a> Website).-->
    </p>
    
    
    <h4>By airplane and bus</h4>
    <p>
        The closest airports in the proximity of L’Aquila are <a href="https://www.adr.it/fiumicino">Fiumicino Airport</a> - <a href="https://www.adr.it/ciampino">Ciampino Airport</a> (Rome) and <a href="https://www.abruzzoairport.com">Aeroporto d’Abruzzo</a> (Pescara). Two companies bus operate an express coach service directly connecting both Fiumicino and Ciampino Airports to L'Aquila. The trip takes about 2h from Fiumicino and 1h45m from Ciampino. Please check the timetables on <a href="https://www.gasparionline.it/">Gaspari</a> and/or <a href="https://www.flixbus.it">Flixbus</a>. Otherwise you must catch a train to Tiburtina station and then catch a bus to L'Aquila.
    </p>
    <p>
        When in L'Aquila, buses stop at Hotel Amiternum. The best way to reach GSSI from the Hotel Amiternum, is to get a taxi cab, which are normally available at the Hotel Amiternum. Also, it is possible to call Radio-Taxi company (+39) 086225165 - www.radiotaxilaquila.it. This service is available every day from 07:00 to 00:30, but you can book a run after 00:30 if you call before 19:00. Another way to reach GSSI from Hotel Amiternum, is taking any city bus to the city centre. Get off at Collemaggio Terminal Bus “Lorenzo Natali” is a 8 minute walk from GSSI.
    </p>
    <p>       
        From Rome Fiumicino airport you can also use the train to the station Roma Tirburtina (about 35 minutes) and take a bus to L'Aquila (about 1h30min): see train and bus.
    </p>

    <!--<h3>By train and bus</h3>
    <p>
        While L'Aquila rail station is not well connected, frequent bus connections are available from the train station Rome Tiburtina in Rome. This station is served with frequent high-speed service by both main Italian rail companies (Trenitalia and Italo). If your train only stops in another station, e.g. Roma Termini, take the metro (line B) to reach Roma Tiburtina.
    </p>
    <p>
        Buses from Rome Tiburtina are offered (among others) by TUA, Flixbus and Gaspari (about 1h30m). The bus parking lot is in front of the station's main entrance. Buses offered by TUA are the most convenient since they arrive at Collemagio Terminal Bus (about 500m from GSSI), while Gaspari and Flibux buses arrive at Hotel Amiternum.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information about how to reach the GSSI from the bus stops in L'Aquila see airplane instructions above.
    </p>

    <h3>By car</h3>
    <p>
        Among other solutions, drivers can take the A24 highway and take the exit "L'Aquila Ovest" or "L'Aquila Est". Then, follow the road signs to the city center and, in particular, those with the logo of the GSSI.
    </p>
    
    <h3>By train</h3>
    <p>
        This is may be the less convenient solution if you are in a hurry, but the small trains that climb the mountains up to L'Aquila from Terni or Sulmona will bring you through really wonderful landscapes. Visit the Trenitalia site for timetables. From the L'Aquila train station take a bus or a taxi to GSSI.
