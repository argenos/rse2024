                Turn-based games on graphs are games where the states are controlled by one and only one player who decides which edge to follow. Each player has a temporal objective that he tries to achieve. One player is the designated ‘controller’, whose objective captures the desirable outcomes of the whole system. Cooperative rational synthesis is the problem of computing a Nash equilibrium that satisfies the controller’s objective. We present recent results about this problem in presence of common resources, where each action has a cost or a reward on the shared common pool resources. We consider two types of agents: careless and careful. Careless agents only care for their temporal objective, while careful agents also pay attention not to deplete the resources.

                Reactive synthesis provides us with tools to construct, when they exist, controllers that can give certain guarantees when working in a certain environment. Both the restrictions imposed on and by the environment, and the guarantees the controller aims to achieve are specified in LTL. LTL specifications do not come for free, instead to apply reactive synthesis to the real-world we need to encode our objects of interest (the environment, and the goal/guarantee desired in the context of that environment) in LTL. A problem is that some aspects of the environment, e.g., other robots or programs, may exhibit behaviour not fully expressible in one single (finite) LTL specification. The problem then is what level of abstraction is needed to be able to fully determine realisability/controllability of the specification.

To this end,  we extend the theory by Halpern and Pearl to cope with the continuous nature of such systems. Based on our theory, we develop an analysis technique that is used to uncover the causes for counterexamples of failures resulting from verification techniques. We develop a search-based technique to efficiently produce such causes, implement the technique in a prototype tool and apply it to our case studies.

            Testing in the field is gaining momentum, as a means to identify those faults that escape in-house testing by continuing the testing even while a system is operating in production. Among several approaches that are proposed, this paper focuses on the important notion of self-adaptivity of testing in the field, as such techniques clearly need to adapt in many ways their strategy to the context and the emerging behaviors of the system under test. In this work, we investigate the topic by conducting a scoping review of the literature on self-adaptive testing in the field. We rely on a taxonomy organized in a number of categories that include the object to adapt, the adaptation trigger, its temporal characteristics, realization issues, interaction concerns, the classification of field-based approach, and its impact/cost. Our study sheds light on self-adaptive testing in the field by identifying related key concepts and key characteristics and extracting some knowledge gaps to better guide future research.

                The Robot Operating System (ROS) is the de-facto standard in robotics research. In fact, in 2019, the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) estimated that 70\% of the robotic applications are, in practice, based on ROS. The growing success of ROS may be attributed to its design for modularity. The modular design in ROS facilitates interoperability of reusable software artifacts from varied manufacturers. It also promotes late binding software components for dealing with dynamicity--a recurring problem in robotics. Interoperability and late-binding empower designers of ROS-based applications but pose challenges to trustworthy robotics behavior. After all, the emerging behavior of combining the components is left to runtime, asking to gain confidence with runtime assurance techniques. Employing runtime assurance is work for the quality assurance and development teams. On the one hand, the quality assurance team of a ROS-based application must deal with black-box components, unpredictable ordering of the modules, and interaction with the physical environment. On the other hand, the development team should care to alleviate for observability and controllability, preparing the robot code for further assurance provisioning. This study synthesizes guidance to the quality assurance and design teams in delivering sound ROS-based systems. To this end, we combine (i) a literature review on studies addressing runtime assurance (i.e., runtime verification and field-based testing) to gain confidence in ROS applications and (ii) mining design principles from observable and controllable ROS-based applications repositories. In this presentation, I should discuss early findings and results of our investigations.

            Context: Software Testing is a costly activity since the size of the test case set tends to increase as the construction of the software evolves. Test Case Prioritization (TCP) can reduce the effort and cost of software testing. TCP is an activity where a subset of the existing test cases is selected in order to maximize the possibility of finding defects. On the other hand, Markov Chains representing a reactive system, when solved, can present the occupation time of each of their states. The idea is to use such information and associate priority to those test cases that consist of states with the highest probabilities. Objective: The objective of this paper is to conduct a survey to identify and understand key initiatives for using Markov Chains in TCP. Aspects such as approaches, developed techniques, programming languages, analytical and simulation results, and validation tests are investigated. Methods: A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted considering studies published up to July 2021 from five different databases to answer the three research questions. Results: From SLR, we identified 480 studies addressing Markov Chains in TCP that have been reviewed in order to extract relevant information on a set of research questions. Conclusion: The final 12 studies analyzed use Markov Chains at some stage of test case prioritization in a distinct way, that is, we found that there is no strong relationship between any of the studies, not only on how the technique was used but also in the context of the application. Concerning the fields of application of this subject, 6 forms of approach were found: Controlled Markov Chain, Usage Model, Model-Based Test, Regression Test, Statistical Test, and Random Test. This demonstrates the versatility and robustness of the tool. A large part of the studies developed some prioritization tool, being its validation done in some cases analytically and in others numerically, such as: Measure of the software specification, Optimal Test Transition Probabilities, Adaptive Software Testing, Automatic Prioritization, Ant Colony Optimization, Model Driven approach, and Monte Carlo Random Testing.

                Architecting Cyber-Physical Systems is not trivial since their intrinsic nature of mixing software and hardware components poses several challenges, especially when the physical space is subject to dynamic changes, e.g., paths of robots suddenly not feasible due to objects occupying transit areas or doors being closed with a high probability. This paper provides a quantitative evaluation of different architectural patterns that can be used for cyber-physical systems to understand which patterns are more suitable under some peculiar characteristics of dynamic spaces, e.g., frequency of obstacles in paths. We use stochastic performance models to evaluate architectural patterns, and we specify the dynamic aspects of the physical space as probability values. This way, we aim to support software architects with quantitative results indicating how different design patterns affect some metrics of interest, e.g., the system response time. Experiments show that there is no unique architectural pattern suitable to cope with all the dynamic characteristics of physical spaces. Each architecture differently contributes when varying the physical space, and it is indeed beneficial to switch among multiple patterns for an optimal solution.

                Nowadays, marine data producers have to perform data quality control manually before publishing collected data. This process is labour-demanding, time-consuming, and may expose bad data to the public. Detecting anomalies is a suitable approach to automate this task. Unsupervised machine learning based on predictive model appears to be a cost-effective solution and has been increasingly employed for anomaly detection in recent years. However, existing methods encounter at least one of the following issues: empirically setting predefined thresholds to identify anomalous data, storing all residual errors to derive thresholds automatically and dynamically, and being inadaptive to data distribution changes. The first problem makes the method inflexible, while the others demand expensive computation power and worsen performance over time. In this paper, we propose a framework consisting of lightweight deep learning model based on Long short-term memory (LSTM) and unsupervised machine learning. The model is accompanied by a cost-effective dynamic thresholding function to determine anomalies in real-time. Our framework can address all the issues mentioned above and detect anomalies in marine time-series data in a real-time manner.

                Reusing code is a common developer activity in software engineering. It has been practiced since the early days of programming and helps developers in building larger and more complex systems faster, the idea being that there is no need to reinvent the wheel. What can be achieved with a single copy-paste operation for simple methods grows a lot more complicated when dealing with reuse and incorporation of entire software features. The latter requires the extraction and transplantation of dependent code, called by the feature or required for calling it in the first place. In recent years, a new branch of research has been established, focussing on the automization of this task. While considerable advancements were achieved, existing approaches share some key limitations, such as being restricted to non-scattered features or requiring extensive user input, e.g., defining the insertion point for the transplanted code or mechanisms to assert correctness of transplantation. This talk will discuss these issues and explore ideas for advancing the state-of-the-art of feature transplantation.

                To verify and validate mobile robots, which usually operate in dynamic environments, the stakeholders must argue effectively that the robot is able to perform all of its tasks safely. Developers can expose the system to as many different situations as possible to show that the system can operate in different conditions, but to do so in simulation is challenging. Creating a 3D model for simulation is time-consuming and requires knowledge of 3D modelling tools, but even for an experienced user of such tools recreating a real-world environment or creating multiple variations of one can become a difficult task to achieve, especially under time constraints. One way to reduce the time required to obtain 3D environments is to leverage the power of model-to-model transformations, and generate the 3D environments from a textual model. This talk introduces a modelling language and tooling that enables developers of mobile robot systems to describe and recreate an existing environment using the modelling language, and to later annotate probability distributions to features of the environment to derive new variations. The tooling makes it possible for developers to execute tests in simulation in multiple environments more efficiently.
