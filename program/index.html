                During the last two decades, service choreography has been receiving considerable attention by the research community as a versatile approach for building service-based distributed systems. In business computing, service choreography is a form of service composition in which the interaction protocol among software services is defined from a global perspective. By embracing the main characteristic of distributed systems, the idea underlying the notion of service choreography can be summarised as follows: "dancers dance following a global scenario without a single point of control".

                The increasing adoption of robots in industry creates a demand to enable robots to interact in order to form teamwork Autonomous Systems - a set of collaborative agents that interact and behave as if they were a single capable agent, pursuing a set of joint goals. Teamwork plans are not only important because of workload sharing, but also due to the fact that the capabilities of a team exceed the ones of an individual. Correct-by-design techniques that ensure the safety and reliability of such systems are emerging, but are not that advanced. Namely, Reactive Synthesis and Supervisory Control are viable candidates. They permit producing robust controllers with assurances on correctness and guarantees on meeting design goals.

                Autonomous vehicles are now used for a variety of scientific, military, and civilian applications. The piloting and control of these vehicles have gotten significantly easier alongside the evolution of the technology driving these vehicle's capabilities as the actuation, communication, and batteries, to name a few. In particular, these applications can now use robotic toolkits and their specific communication protocols to deploy several vehicles at once for a common purpose in a dynamic networked environment.

                Systems of agents may display a surprisingly complex collective behaviour that emerges as a result of the individuals interacting with each other. This kind of phenomenon is commonplace in nature, and by replicating it we would likely obtain a new generation of robust and adaptive robotic systems. However, developing such systems is challenging due to a lack of sufficiently high-level specification languages on one hand, and of adequate analysis tools on the other.  In this talk, we describe a simple language and associated tooling that may address these lacks.

                Modern systems are increasingly autonomous thanks to the widespread use of AI technologies and their impact on the social, economic, and political spheres is becoming evident. Worries about the growth of the data economy and the increasing presence of AI-enabled Autonomous Systems (ASs) have shown that privacy concerns are insufficient: other ethical values and human dignity are at stake. Humans should be supported in controlling the systemâs autonomy by enabling them to take the operational control of the system when they feel that it would be necessary or by assuring that the systemsâ decisions comply with their ethical preferences, without violating regulations and laws. In this presentation, we introduce HALO, which enables users to express their moral preferences and, then, adjusting the systemâs autonomy and the related interaction protocols. The customization of the systemâs autonomy is guaranteed by a software mediator that, depending on the userâs ethical preferences, first determines the new level of autonomy and then (re-)distributes autonomy and control among the involved entities (e.g., systemâs components, software agents, humans interacting with the system, ecc.). HALO is demonstrated with a robotic example.

                Machine learning techniques are widely used for speech recognition, image recognition and text mining, all set of data that presents a certain degree of concreteness. We are interested in understanding the scope of these techniques when applied on human data that represents their moral values and their ethical positions. The final goal is to profile userâs according to their ethical positions in order to predict their digital actions. Our research question is the following: is it possible to create a moral profile for each user? Which data and which machine learning techniques should be used? This profile should consider the userâs desiderata as well as their actual behavior in the digital world. Profiling and prediction of behaviors will be exploited to build a software exoskeleton to empower the user when interacting with the digital world. The main purpose of the exoskeleton is to help the user cooperating fairly with robots and autonomous systems, by protecting userâs privacy as well as fostering their collaboration.

            The advent of a particular class of software that will manage human-computer interaction according to ethical principles is imminent. The European Data Protection Supervisor calls it "moralware." Never before has ethics been such a critical issue in designing a future in which humans and robots will work closely together, a collaboration of which we already see concrete examples, from space exploration to autonomous driving on some roads. In this area of joint research between philosophers and computer scientists, it is interesting to assess the state of the art of the many "human ethics" and how these can be implemented in the digital world to make the interaction between robots and humans fair, equitable, and respectful of the rights of individuals and communities. Starting with privacy as an ethical dimension, we began by investigating the possibility of bringing out values typical of humans in order to best ensure their respect. This approach can certainly be expanded to robotic design with the idea of creating machines that serve human beings, respecting their characteristics and uniqueness.

                In these last years the use of robots as increasingly more autonomous machines that assist and help humans in daily activities has increased (e.g., semiautonomous flying robots or driver-less cars). This means that robots must be equiped not only with cognitive abilities but also with ethical capacities, that garantee safe interactions with humans. In general, previous approaches faced this issue relying on the verification of logic statements. More recently, the idea that robots should be able of modelling and therefore predicting the consequences of actions to behave compatibly with humans' needs, that is without harming humans or even themselves, has emerged. At the aim, the simulation approach has been used to equipe robots with ethics. This approach assumes that modal simulations can arise in the brain, as partial reactivations of sensori-motor and introspective states formed on the basis of experience (e.g., mental imagery is the best-known case of non-automatic simulation). Thus, thinking would imply building a grounded model of the environment, which is not composed of abstract symbols but rather by perceptual (modal) symbols, by which robots can covertly simulate actions and their consequences. In other words, giving analogic mental representations to robots can be the first step towards ethical robots. In this vein, the role of the mirror neurons might be also explored to implement ethical actions in robots.
